  <h2>Thoughts About Endpoint Managmement Software</h2>
  <p>Over the past year I have worked a bit on expanding my knowledge of configuration management / endpoint management software (such as Ansible, and Intune).</p>
<h3 id="ansible">Ansible</h3>
<p>Ansible in my opinion is wonderful, historically i&rsquo;ve used shell scripts to manage my Linux nodes but Ansible allows me to actually see @ a glance if my configuration applied or not. With shell scripts I&rsquo;d run my script against the node and i&rsquo;d have to verify that it applied correctly. Ansible immediately tells me if a task failed, was skipped or was &ldquo;ok&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ansible also applies immediately which is perfect for me as well.</p>
<h3 id="intune">Intune</h3>
<p>Intune is cool, but my major gripe with it is that it doesn&rsquo;t apply the configurations immediately.</p>
<p>This lack of immediate response is annoying to me because historically on Windows i&rsquo;ve used PDQ deploy in a similar way to how I use Ansible on Linux (to apply software and configuraton files to remote nodes). Intune is great for maintaining a configuration on the end node but the lack of immediate response makes the testing and verification process I perform against either my test nodes or the prod nodes a much more time consuming ordeal.</p>
<p>Even though I dislike the lack of immediate response, I really like Intune&rsquo;s integration with Microsoft Entra ID (the new name for Azure AD). With Entra if I were doing IT at a small/medium company I could just point all my Windows machines to Entra for the &ldquo;AD Join&rdquo; and then host my own dhcp, dns and other various servers (which i&rsquo;d need locally) on Linux. Based on my understanding this would remove my need for CALS (which i&rsquo;ve never liked the thought of having to pay for). I&rsquo;m sure Microsoft still makes a good profit from their 365 / Entra / Intune / Office cloud licensing so it&rsquo;s likely a Win/Win.</p>
