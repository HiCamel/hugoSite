  <h2>The Need to Buy New Things</h2>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but I have a strong compulsion to buy new and novel things.</p>
<p>I think this was programmed into me by watching an absolute ton of television when I was younger, seeing all the Pokemon, Street Sharks, Beetleborgs, Power Ranger commercials as well as all the video game magazines that I used to read.</p>
<p>Now I know that I really don&rsquo;t need to buy whatever the latest thing is and I do my best to resist the call. It can be difficult sometimes though.</p>
<p>I typically resist the need to buy things by doing the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Looking around my house to see if I have anything that matches my latest object of desire.</li>
<li>Waiting before buying the new thing.
<ul>
<li>If I wait long enough I usually stop wanting the latest thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Figuring out new ways to use what I already have to accomplish what I want to buy the latest thing for.
<ul>
<li>In most cases I am usually resourceful enough to find new ways to use what I have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult sometimes but money really doesn&rsquo;t grow on trees (so I can&rsquo;t just spend frivolously).</p>
