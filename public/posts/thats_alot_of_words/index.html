<p><strong>Too Bad i&rsquo;m not readin em</strong></p>
<p>On my first run through college (2007 &ndash; 2011). I had an english professor named Pagaard (pronounced Pay Guard as he would always say).</p>
<p>Pagaard&rsquo;s philosophy was that you should use as few words as possible while fully explaining what you are trying to communicate. Pagaard&rsquo;s main thought on this subject was that language is used for communication, if you use too many words you can muddy the waters.</p>
<p>I met other people who worked in various business jobs (like owning their own businesses) who also preferred short explanations (think 30 second elevator pitches).</p>
<p>In my personal experience, I find that when I don&rsquo;t understand a topic fully, I tend to use way too many words to explain the topic. When I mostly understand a topic I can effectively explain the topic in a few words.</p>
