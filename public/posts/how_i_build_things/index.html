  <h2>How I Build Things</h2>
  <p>Before AI, I typically started out with an idea of what I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish based on some need that I have.</p>
<p>I write out a list of steps that I need to accomplish said task.</p>
<p>After my list is written out I would fill in the details beneath each step (like how I would accomplish subtasks to accomplish the overaching step).</p>
<p>If I am writing a script I would then decide of each step should be a function or if it&rsquo;s okay to just write the code in my main execution area.</p>
<p>Now that we have LLMs I can typically ping chatgpt a few times to see what it thinks about how I can accomplish something. ChatGPT isn&rsquo;t always correct but it can provide a nice framework for whatever it is I am trying to accomplish (and reduces the mental load of trying to write my own framework). I find that sometimes I have to go back to my old method of developing a new process or (config / script / plan) (ChatGPT isn&rsquo;t always reliable).</p>
