  <h2>PXE server configuration - Homelab - Ethernet NIC on back of AIO computer</h2>
  <h2 id="background">Background:</h2>
<p>Recently I began expanding my homelab. Historically @ home I used usb drives to flash linux onto new computers that I purchased but I was getting tired of losing said usb drives.</p>
<p>Because of this I began thinking about how i&rsquo;ve imaged devices in the past. I remembered that once, at one of the companies I worked at I configured a PXE server such that I could image about 30 laptops for a programming interview/test that the company was doing so that they could hire more people.</p>
<h2 id="background-on-pxe">Background on pxe:</h2>
<p>PXE booting is used mainly for installing operating systems over the network.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-plan-to-use-pxe">How I plan to use PXE:</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, I planned to use PXE to image new computers as I expand my home lab.</p>
<h2 id="my-configuration-at-home">My configuration at home:</h2>
<p>Currently as of May 2025, I have a All-In-One computer that I use as my main PC, I also have a couple of SFF PCs that i&rsquo;m using as proxmox servers (which host various things).</p>
<p>My desktop (the All-In-One) is connected to my wireless router, through the wireless NIC. Because of this I had an idea that I could use the Ethernet port on the back of my computer to host a PXE server.</p>
