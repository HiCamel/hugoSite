      <description>Background: Recently I began expanding my homelab. Historically @ home I used usb drives to flash linux onto new computers that I purchased but I was getting tired of losing said usb drives.
Because of this I began thinking about how i&amp;rsquo;ve imaged devices in the past. I remembered that once, at one of the companies I worked at I configured a PXE server such that I could image about 30 laptops for a programming interview/test that the company was doing so that they could hire more people.</description>
