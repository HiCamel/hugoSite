Welcome to my site! My name is M. This is the About page.

Here you can learn more about me and what I do.

I work in IT for a living, my specialty is Linux administraton but I also have a wide variety of other skills both in and out of the technology world.

I've been working in IT for over a decade. started when I was 22 and built up my skills gradually over the years.

The purpose of this site is to write down ideas and thoughts such that they will help me to continue my educational journey (with a side effect of possibly helping whoever stumbles across my blog).
