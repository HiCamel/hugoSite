My favorite side dish is rice. One way to make rice better though is to add a bit of tomato boullion into it (instead of salt).

1. First you take 1 cup of rice
1. Add it into the rice cooker with 1.5 cups of water
1. Add about a teaspoon of tomato boullion. I use the tomato boullion pictured above
1. Let the rice cooker work it's magic (wait till it finishes cooking the rice).
1. Enjoy!
