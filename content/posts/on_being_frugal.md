It's good to be frugal, try to participate in the circular economy on Facebook Marketplace.

You really only need a computer, a tv and a phone, all other electronics are bloat.

A 6th gen intel i5 with 16 gb of ram can run pretty much everything that is needed for programming at the level that you operate at. If you are doing anything that requires more compute or gpu resources it is cheaper (or free) to use cloud services.

You don't need to buy boats, land, cabins in nature, other luxuries. It is cheaper to rent the luxuries listed in the previous sentence and if you bought them you'd just get tired of them and stop using them. Building on this, "variety is the spice of life".

Coupons are great, use them.
