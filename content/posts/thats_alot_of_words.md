**Too Bad i'm not readin em**

On my first run through college (2007 -- 2011). I had an English professor named Pagaard (pronounced Pay Guard as he would always say).

Pagaard's philosophy was that you should use as few words as possible while fully explaining what you are trying to communicate. Pagaard's main thought on this subject was that language is used for communication, if you use too many words you can muddy the waters.

I met other people who worked in various business jobs (like owning their own businesses) who also preferred short explanations (think 30 second elevator pitches).

In my personal experience, I find that when I don't understand a topic fully, I tend to use way too many words to explain the topic. When I mostly understand a topic I can effectively explain the topic in a few words.
