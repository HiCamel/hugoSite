Sometimes in life things can look very different but actually be the same thing.

I was browsing facebook one day and came across the following meme.

![marioJump.jpg](/marioJump.jpg)

In the above picture there are two very different block layouts, however the result of missing the jump to any of the blocks in each layout is that Mario will fall into the pit.

Even though the picture on the right has more blank space the end result is similar to the picture on the left (either you jump over the obstacle or you fall into the pit).

Many things in life can be like this. Mexican food and Italian food are often like this as well (same ingredients, different combinations). With Italian food it is usually some kind of pasta, tomato sauce and meat, with these three ingrediants you could make spaghetti, lasagna, ravioli, etc. With Mexican food it is usually some kind of tortilla, meat, sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion and maybe a pepper.

Instead of buying sushi you could also just make some rice, add some canned tuna, soy sauce and wasabi and have a similar meal which is much cheaper than buying actual sushi. You could even roll up this rice and tuna dish like a sushi roll (just buy one of those sushi cannons or the rolling mat).

Anyways, the point of this is to be less picky, if something is functionally similar to something else then it is basically the same thing. And if the price is lower then it's a win for you.
