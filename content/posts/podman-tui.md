I'm really into doing things as simply as possible. Because of this, I spend countless hours searching across the internet to find new and better ways to accomplish my goals.

In my searches I came across a program called "podman-tui".

Podman-tui simplifies container administration w/ podman. Best part is it is available in the repositories for RHEL (so you can use it @ your job).

Below is a gif taken from the github page for podman-tui, really cool stuff, much better than memorizing a bunch of commands when you're first getting into containers.
