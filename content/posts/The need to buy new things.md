I don't know about you but I have a strong compulsion to buy new and novel things.

I think this was programmed into me by watching an absolute ton of television when I was younger, seeing all the Pokemon, Street Sharks, Beetleborgs, Power Ranger commercials as well as all the video game magazines that I used to read.

Now I know that I really don't need to buy whatever the latest thing is and I do my best to resist the call. It can be difficult sometimes though.

I typically resist the need to buy things by doing the following

1. Looking around my house to see if I have anything that matches my latest object of desire.
1. Waiting before buying the new thing.
	- If I wait long enough I usually stop wanting the latest thing.
1. Figuring out new ways to use what I already have to accomplish what I want to buy the latest thing for.
	- In most cases I am usually resourceful enough to find new ways to use what I have.


It's difficult sometimes but money really doesn't grow on trees (so I can't just spend frivolously).
